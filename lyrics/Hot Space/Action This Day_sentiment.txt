utter.
 a sight of a light at.
e end of a tunnel.
ill there's a feeling, this world is using me.
tion this day.
tion this night.
've gotta learn to learn to live to love.
u can't say it ain't right.
tion this day.
tion this night.
u've got the power, you've got the power.
u've got the power to love and to live.
u can't say it ain't right.
ur mind honey is a bleak place.
ving in your mind's living in a bleak place.
ur mind is coming from a rat race.
t there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on.
mping.
ke a jukebox playing the same dead record.
 a radio in the corner keeps blaring.
gotta feeling that just won't quit, this.
rld is using me.
tion this day.

've gotta learn to learn to live to love.
 can't say it ain't right.
tion this day.

u've got the power, you've got the power.
u've got the power to love, to live.
u can't say it ain't right.
tion.
