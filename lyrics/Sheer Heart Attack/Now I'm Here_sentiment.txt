st a new man.
s you made me live again.
baby I was when you took my hand.
d the light of the night burned bright.
d the people all stared didn't understand.
t you knew my name on sight.
atever came of you and me.
erica's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound.
wn in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me.
n't I love her so.
thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky.
ere the beams of your lovelight chase.
n't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain.
th a rain running down my face.
ur matches still light up the sky.
d many a tear lives on in my eye.
wn in the city just Hoople 'n' me.
n't I love him so.
atever comes of you and me.
love to leave my memory with you.
w I'm here.
ink I'll stay around around around.
'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me.
n't I love you so .
