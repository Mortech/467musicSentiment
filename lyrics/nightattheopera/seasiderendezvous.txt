Seaside - whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what
you feel inside meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine -
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can - I love you madly -
Let me imagination run away with you gladly -
A brand new angle - highly commendable - Seaside Rendezvous -

I feel so romantic - can we do it again
Can we do it again sometime,
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the
Mediterranean -, this time of year, it's so fashionable,
I feel like dancing - in the tain,
All I need is a volunteer -
Dancing - what a damn jolly good idea -
It's such a jollification - as a matter of fact, so tres charmant my dear -

Underneath the moonlight - together we'll sail across the sea -
Reminiscing every night
Meantime - I ask you to be my valentine
You say you do if you did but you daren't I'll be your Valentino -
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino -
Get a new facial - so sensational -
Seaside Rendezvous - so adorable,
Seaside Rendezvous -
