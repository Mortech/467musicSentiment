I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things.
We can do the tango just for two.
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings.
Be your Valentino just for you.
Ooh love - Ooh Loverboy.
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy -.
Set my alarm, turn on my charm.
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned loverboy.
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster).
Ooh Ooh let me feel your love heat.
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love.
And tell me how do you feel right after-all.
I'd like for you and I to go romancing.
Say the word - your wish is my command.
Ooh love - Ooh loverboy.
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy.
Write my letter.
Feel much better.
I'll use my fancy patter on the telephone.
When I'm not with you.
I think of you always.
I miss you -.
(I miss those long hot summer nights).
When I'm not with you.
Think of me always.
I love you - Love you.
Hey boy where do you get it from.
Hey boy where did you go.
I learned my passion in the good old.
fashioned school of loverboys-.
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely.
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine.
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely.
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (Come on and get it).
Ooh love, Ooh loverboy.
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy -.
Everything's all right.
Just hold on tight -.
That's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy.
